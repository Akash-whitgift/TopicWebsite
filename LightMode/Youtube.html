    <h1>Youtube</h1>
    <p>Youtube is an American vdieo sharing platform that is know for the long form content, although recently there has been a change in strategy as they have been branching into Short form content. This is because of the rise of tiktok <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TikTok"> [more info here] </a>, a vdieo platform that specialised in short form content. This means that youtube was forced to launch Youtube Shorts, their competetor to Tiktok.</p>
