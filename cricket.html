    <h1>Cricket</h1>
    <p>Cricket is a popular sport played in many countries around the world, especially in South Asia, England, Australia, and New Zealand. It is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of 11 players each.</p><p>The objective of the game is to score more runs than the opposing team. A run is scored when a player hits the ball and then runs to the other end of the pitch, crossing the crease without getting out. The team with the highest number of runs at the end of the game wins.</p><p>The game is played on a large oval-shaped field with a rectangular 22-yard-long pitch in the middle. The two teams take turns batting and fielding. When a team is batting, they try to score as many runs as possible while the other team tries to get them out. When a team is fielding, they try to prevent the batting team from scoring runs and to get them out.</p><p>There are many ways to get out in cricket, including getting caught, getting bowled out, getting stumped, getting run out, or being hit wicket. The game is controlled by two umpires, who ensure that the rules are followed and make decisions on whether a player is out or not.</p><p>Cricket is played at both amateur and professional levels, and there are international competitions such as the Cricket World Cup and the Ashes series between England and Australia. The game has a rich history and culture, with many traditions and rivalries that continue to captivate fans around the world.</p><p class='translucentText'>All of the text above was written by ChatGPT</p>
